<item title="Review of Channel changes" description="Google announced in January, 2019 the Picasa API was going away. This prompted an expedited change to implement the new Google Photos API. While it does offer new features (see: Shared Album Support), we lost some support as well.&#xA;&#xA; - Google 'Smart Search' is not yet implemented.&#xA;&#xA; - Loss of album 'paging ability'. Previous / Next buttons have been added to assist with this limitation.&#xA;&#xA; - Slideshow Limitation. Due to Google API limits, Slideshows have been limited to 12 hours, Screensaver limted to 4 hours.&#xA;&#xA;More details: https://www.roku-photoview.com/releases" />
