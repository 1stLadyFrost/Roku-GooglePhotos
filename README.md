# Roku-GooglePhotos (aka Roku-PhotoView)
Roku Google Photos Channel is currently going through a major rewrite to intigrate ScreenGraph features required by Roku.
See: https://github.com/chtaylo2/Roku-GooglePhotos/issues/44

This is an active development, to checked in code to this branch is likely to not work!

Thanks,
Chris Taylor

Want to help integrate a new feature? Outside development is welcomed as long as the new code adds to user experience. Any new development work should be tracked in an "Issue" and assigned to yourself. Once ready to commit code, merge into the 'development' branch for testing. After all tests have passed, it would be merged into the 'master' branch and released during next release cycle.
