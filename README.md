# Roku-GooglePhotos (aka Roku-PhotoView)
Roku Google Photos Channel is currently going through a major rewrite to intigrate ScreenGraphs.
See: https://github.com/chtaylo2/Roku-GooglePhotos/issues/44

This is an active development, to checked in code to this branch is likely to not work!

Thanks,
Chris Taylor
